# RESTful API v2

TestProject exposes a RESTful API which allows R&D teams to schedule and trigger automation, get status and retrieve testing results. The API is particularly useful when you build your CI pipeline and use TestProject as a centralized test automation execution grid. This management API is auto-enabled for all TestProject accounts. If you donâ€™t have a TestProject account yet, go ahead and create a [free account](https://testproject.io/).



You can find an interactive swagger documentation [here](https://api.testproject.io/docs/v2/).
