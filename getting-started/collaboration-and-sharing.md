# Collaboration and Sharing

There are several ways to collaborate within TestProject. If you want to work closely with teammates, you can invite them to your account so that you can all collaborate together. You can also take a more targeted approach and just share a particular test with people. 

## Inviting Teammates to Your Account

One of the key features of TestProject is team collaboration. By inviting teammates to your account, you can share all of your testing assets: agents, test cases, data sources, reports, applications, etc. 

To add a new team member, click on the share center option at the top of the page:

Type in your team member's email address and click **Next**. You will be presented with the options for granting permission for your team member. You can restrict him/her to specific projects, or grant him/her administrator rights. Once you have finished setting permissions, click on the **Finish** button.

That's it! Your team member will get an email with a link to join your account, and can complete the process by clicking that link to create a password to log in.

## Sharing Tests

In order to share tests with someone, go to that test in the project viewer and click on the menu item beside it. You can then choose the **Share Test** option.

Enter in the email addresses of those you want to share the test with and then click on the Share button. Review the terms of service and if they are acceptable, click on the I agree button and your contacts will be emailed a link to the test. 

You can also create publicly sharable links to a test. You can do that on the Share Test panel by copying the link, or by using the **Get Direct Link** option on the menu.
