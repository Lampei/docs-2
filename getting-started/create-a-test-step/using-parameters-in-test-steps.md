# Using Parameters in Test Steps

Parameters are a very helpful way to organize and extend the capabilities of tests. Parameters can be used when there is a text box input with and add parameters plus icon beside it.

Click on the plus icon opens the parameters widget where you can use already defined parameters or define you own.

## What is a parameter?

A parameter is a way to store some information into a variable that can be manipulated in various ways. For example, an input parameter can be defined that has a certain value, and then at run time it can be set to have another value, or it can be set to programatically take on several values through [_data driven testing_](../../schedule-and-run-tests/using-data-driven-jobs-in-testproject.md). Another example is to parameterize the output of  test step so that the value can be used in another step later on in the test.

## Input and Output Parameters

Test steps can have two different types of parameters. Input parameters are parameters that give the test some input. An input parameter might be some text that gets typed into a field on the page or a numerical value that gets assigned.

Output parameters on the other hand are used to store information that is generated by a test step. When creating output parameters, it is important to remember to not give it a value since the value will be assigned by the test step when it runs. Output parameters can be used to pass data between test steps or to check on the value of certain field programatically. 

## Combining Parameters with Direct Inputs

Parameters can be used on an input field on their own or they can be used together with non-parameterized inputs.

When combing the two types of inputs together it is important to be sure that the input box is cleared before starting. The easiest way to create something like the above example, is to create the desired parameters and then clear the text box completely. Type `Hi` and then click on the FirstName parameter to add it and then type the rest of that sentence. Click on the next parameter to finish the setup of this input. Setting it up in the linear way helps to ensure that TestProject correctly understands the combination of inputs given.
