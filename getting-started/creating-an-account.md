## Inviting Teammates to Your Account

One of the key features of TestProject is team collaboration. By inviting teammates to your account, you can share all of your testing assets: agents, test cases, data sources, reports, applications, etc. 

To add a new team member, click on the "Invite Teammate" button at the top of the page:
