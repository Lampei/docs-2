# Installation and Setup

Once you have [created an account](creating-an-account.md) with TestProject you just need to follow a few simple steps to get setup and ready for testing.  TestProject works on almost any platform, with the install of a single agent.

The first thing you will need to do is to login the TestProject app. Once you have done that you can go to the agents tab at the top of the page and click on the platform you are on to download the agent executable.  Once that download has finished you can run it to install the TestProject agent on your machine.

After that there is only one step left. You need to register you agent with the TestProject app so that you can use it to create and run tests. In order to do that, the agent needs to be running on your local machine. You can start it up by finding the installed TestProjectAgent executable on your machine and running that.

### Starting the TestProject Agent

#### Windows

On Windows the easiest way to run the agent is just to search for TestProject in the Windows search bar and clicking on the Agent to start it.

The agent will then start up on your computer and you will be able to see the status of it by right clicking on the icon in the system tray.

## Register the Agent

You will be prompted to give your agent an alias. Put something meaningful in here like "Joe Smith's Windows laptop" as it is possible to share agents with other team members. Once you have done that you just need to click on the register button to automatically register your agent with the TestProject application, and now you are ready to start using TestProject!
