# Using AI to Improve Testing

Artificial Intelligence is a much discussed topic. Some talk about AI as if it will replace testers, but here at TestProject we believe in the incredible value that testers can add to any project. We also believe that AI is a powerful tool that has come a long way in the last few years. In our goal to help testers become better at what they do, we have looked into ways that we can leverage this technology in our product so that we can help testers get even better at what they do.

One thing that many test automation teams have found is that test maintenance takes up a lot of time. Often tests will fail due to changing or moving locators. Humans can easily correct for this, but traditional test automation can't. This leads to a lot of time being spent on updating tests. This kind of work can be tedious and so TestProject has created self-healing capabilities. This AI-driven capability will identify one main way to identify an element, but will also find a number of other possible ways to find the element. If something breaks such that the primary locator strategy does not work, it will automatically detect that it is broken and then use the fallback strategies to find the element for you.

This results in testers spending much less of their valuable time in debugging tests that unnecessarily fail. In turn, this frees up the testers to dig deeper into the application, find more important bugs, and add more valuable tests.

With the power of AI-driven, self-healing tests TestProject has made it possible to have tests that are easy to create, run, and maintain.
