# Manage TestProject Agents

TestProject agents allows you to create and run tests on local machine. They are easy to [install](../getting-started/installation-and-setup.md) and can also be used in collaboration with other team members. Each member of your team can install an agent on their machine and choose if it is a public agent or not. Public agents can then be accessed and shared across the team. This is a powerful way to create a test lab without needing to buy a large number of devices. For example, if you have some team members with Windows machines and some with Mac machines, you can share the use of those devices and get the cross platform coverage that you need. 

If you want to restrict your agent to only be accessible for you, you can go to the agents tab and find your agent in the list and disable the Public Agent option.

You can turn this option on and off as needed and so control how each agent is used.
