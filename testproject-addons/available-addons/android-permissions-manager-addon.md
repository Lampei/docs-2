# Android Permissions Manager Addon

This addon provides actions to grant or revoke Android permissions for the application under test. Being able to do this allows you to test how you application might work if it can't access certain permission, or see what might happen if you have been granted incorrect permissions. 

The [github repo for this addon](https://github.com/testproject-io/addons/tree/master/android-permissions-manager) gives more details on which permissions are supported. If you want you can also download or view the code on github as well.
