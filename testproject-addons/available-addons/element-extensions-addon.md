# Element Extensions Addon

TestProject comes with many built in element actions, but the Element Extensions addon expands on these and gives you access to many more ways of interacting with an element. The element action in this addon are for web, andriod and iOS platforms.  One important action this addons provides is the ability to switch between iframes. You can see an example of how to use this [here](../../tips-and-tricks/using-testproject-with-iframes.md) in the documentation.
