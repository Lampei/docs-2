# Generic Extensions Addon

The Generic Extensions addon gives you the ability to interact with files and folders on the device you are testing. It allows you to create folders as well as copy and delete files and get information about the last downloaded file. These extensions work with web, android and iOS platforms and, of course, require file permissions on the device the tests are run on.
