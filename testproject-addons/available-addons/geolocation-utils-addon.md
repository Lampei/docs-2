# Geolocation Utils Addon

Sometimes an app is intended to working differently for people in different locations. The geolocation utils addon makes it possible to test this on both Android and iOS devices. You can set a mock location \(using longitude and latitude\) to test how your app will work in different locations. This addon is an important and helpful one for any application that changes based on geographic location.
