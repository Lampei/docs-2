# Get Page Source \(Mobile\)

The [Get Page Source \(Mobile\) Addon](https://addons.testproject.io/get-page-source-mobile) provides an action to inspect your application hierarchy, write the application hierarchy XML into a file and save it to a required path of your choice. This Addon enables you to take a snapshot of your application’s element hierarchy during the test, and save it locally, for debugging purposes.
