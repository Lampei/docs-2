# Live Currency Converter Addon

If you ever need to convert between different currencies in a test, the live currency converter addon will enable this for you. It provides actions to convert different currencies based on live exchange rates. To use this addon, you need to provide the standard currency code \(eg AUD, CAD, USD, GBP etc.\) for the source and target currencies that you want to convert between. By default the currency converter will use the latest live exchange rates between the given currencies, but if you want you can override that rate with your own static rate.
