# Math Calculations Addon

This addon evaluates simple mathematical and boolean expressions such as plus, minus, divide and multiply which can be combined in one complex expression. For example: 8+5\*\(10-2\)/9. You can find the documentation for how to use EvalEx expressions, [here](https://github.com/uklimaschewski/EvalEx).
