# Phone Numbers Addon

You can use this addon to generate a random mobile phone for more than 150 countries. The generated phone number uses real country codes and mobile operators prefixes and keeps the number to the allowed number length for the country of input. This addon has the following action:

`Generate random phone number`- Generates a random phone number.

### Inputs

This action takes in the `Country` parameter in which you specify the country name \(spelled in English\). If you leave it blank, the action will generate a phone number based on a random country. The input value should be empty or 3 and more characters. You can see full list of available countries [below](phone-numbers-addon.md#full-list-of-countries).

You can also put in just 3 characters of a country name. For example if you want to generate a number for Israel you can type Isr or if you wanted a New Zealand number, zea for New Zealand. It also doesn't matter if you type the country name with lower-case or upper-case.

### Outputs

This action return the following 3 outputs:

* `Code` - The country code portion of the generated number \(e.g. +972\)
* `Codeless number` - A generated phone number without country code \(e.g. 001234567\) 
* `Generated number` - Complete generated number \(e.g. +972001234567\)
