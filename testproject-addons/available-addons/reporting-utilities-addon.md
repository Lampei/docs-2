# Reporting Utilities Addon

This addon provides an action to report a blank step with a specified message. An example of you would want to do this is to add a report step somewhere in your test with a message "Please check these manual steps in bug 1234 once this test has completed"." Then, once the test is run, you will see a step in the report with this message and whoever is running the test will know to manually check the steps in the given bug after that test has completed.
