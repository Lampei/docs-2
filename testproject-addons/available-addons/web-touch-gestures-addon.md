# Web Touch Gestures Addon

This addon lets you perform touch gestures in websites, simulating user interaction with touch screens. The `Flick Element` action will flick the given element in the specified direction. You will need to specify the x-offset and y-offset to tell which direction and how far the element should be flicked.
