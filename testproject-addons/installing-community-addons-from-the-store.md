# Installing Community Addons from the store

In order to install addons that the community has shared, you need to be logged into your TestProject account. You can then navigate to the Addons [page ](https://app.testproject.io/#/addons/community)where you can find the addon that you want. You can browse through them or use the search option to search for an addon that has the commands you want.
