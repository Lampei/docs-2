# How Does an Agent fit into the Ecosystem?

The TestProject agent and the TestProject app work seamless together to give the flexibility of using and controlling your own devices while providing a cloud based way to share an collaborate on effective test case management. The TestProject ecosystem can be summarized with the below diagram.

As the diagram illustrates, local agents enable the recording of new tests and the running of existing tests. When creating a new test with the test recorder, you will specify a local agent to use and that agent will manage all the drivers and other details that are needed to enable seamless test recording. In the same when when running tests you will choose the local agent\(s\) to run them on and those agents take care of all the details of running those tests including using any connected mobile devices.
