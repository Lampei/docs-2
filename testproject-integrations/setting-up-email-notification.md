# Setting up Email Notification

Email notification can be easily setup for any job in TestProject. To set them up, simply navigate to the job you want to receive notifications for and click on the envelope icon.

![Job Notifications](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2827%29%20%282%29.png)

On the resulting dialogue you can choose when you want to be notified and enter in the email address that the notifications should be sent to. You can choose to be notified when the job starts running and/or when it completes. If you choose the On Finish option, you can either have it notify you every time the job completes, or you can have it only notify you if the job execution fails.

Once you have set this up, you will receive email notification when the job is run. If you choose to be notified on run completion you will receive a nice summary of the run with a link to where you can see the full report.
