# Using OpenSDK with Behavior Driven Development

Behavior driver development \(BDD\) is a software development process that encourages collaboration among developers, QA and non-technical or business participants in a software project.

It will encourage the teams to use conversations and concrete examples to formalize how an application should behave.

Behavior driven development stems from test driven development \(TDD\) and acceptance driven development \(ATDD\) and offers the following benefits over them:

* More precise guidance on organizing the conversations between developers, QA and business participants.
* Simpler learning curve, being closer to everyday language, especially the given-when-then approach.
* Easy to update as the product changes, plain language is simple to edit and makes changes in automation safer.
* Snowball effect, scenarios become easier and faster to write and automate as more steps definitions are added. Scenarios will likely share common steps, and new scenarios may need nothing more than a different step parameter.

Here we will learn how to incorporate TestProject into your behavior driven development scenarios using each of the TestProject OpenSDK's.
