# SDK \(v1\)

SDK v1 allows you to package and upload your binaries \(C\# DLL/Java JAR files\) to TestProject’s cloud platform as “Coded Tests”. From that moment, TestProject is responsible for distributing and deploying your tests across multiple Agents. Although SDK v1 is based on Selenium and Appium APIs as well, it uses additional layers of interfaces for supporting the automatic distribution. Thus, users who have existing frameworks may require extra effort adjusting it.
