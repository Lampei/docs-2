# Finding and Using Elements

When creating automated tests it is important to be able to find and use the elements that you need. TestProject provides various ways of finding and accessing elements.  You can use the [Element Locator](element-locator.md), [Element Inspector](element-inspector.md) and [Element Explorer](element-explorer.md) to find the elements that you need to interact with.
