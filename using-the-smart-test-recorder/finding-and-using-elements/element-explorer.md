# Element Explorer

The TestProject Element Explorer can be used to view and examine the structure of mobile application screens. With it you can analyze the element hierarchy, select from different locator strategies, and see all available properties of UI components.  This is very helpful when automating mobile applications as it helps you see how various parts of the application relate to each other in the structure of the application.

You can access the element explorer when you are recording a mobile test, by clicking on the Element Explorer button near the top of page.

This will launch the explorer with a tree view of the application layout that you can drill into and interact with as you study the layout and structure of the application you are testing
