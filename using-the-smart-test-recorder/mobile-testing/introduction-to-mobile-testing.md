# Introduction to Mobile Testing

Creating and running tests on mobile platforms can be difficult and time consuming. However, these tests are often very important to the ongoing success of a project. With the TestProject agent installed, the ability to create and run mobile tests, becomes as easy as connecting a mobile device to your computer and using the TestProject Recorder to create the tests you want. TestProject supports both [android ](creating-an-android-test-using-the-testproject-recorder.md)and [iOS ](creating-an-ios-test-using-the-testproject-recorder.md)devices

## Getting Ready

Before you start recording your first mobile test you will need to make sure you have an agent [setup and installed](../../getting-started/installation-and-setup.md). You will also need to create a project that can hold your test. See the [getting ready ](../web-testing/introduction-to-web-testing.md#getting-ready)section in the web testing area for details on how to do that.
